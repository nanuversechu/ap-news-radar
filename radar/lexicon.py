"""Bilingual entity matching and headline similarity.

This is the piece that would normally be a 2 GB LaBSE model. On a CPU-only
laptop that is a bad trade, so instead we lean on the fact that Andhra Pradesh
news revolves around a knowable cast: about sixty people, places, parties and
recurring topics. Match those in either script and a Telugu headline and its
English twin land on the same canonical signature.

Nothing here is heuristic guesswork about *language* — it is a lookup table you
can read, correct and extend in config.LEXICON.
